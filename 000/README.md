### **PROGRAM FUNCTIONS**
- Accept two numerical inputs as operands
- Accept 1 numerical input to choose an operator
- Add, subtract, multiple, or divide the two accepted operands
- Display result

### **NOTES**
- Started with a beginner program: accept inputs, process inputs, and display output.
- Learned about the basic syntax of cobol.
    - IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
    - PROGRAM-ID.
    - DATA DIVISION.<br>WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
    - PROCEDURE DIVISION.
- Learned about the following statements
    - accept/read user input using _ACCEPT_ statement
    - display using _DISPLAY_ statement
    - assign using _GIVING_ statement instead of _MOVE_ statement
    - evaluate cases using _EVALUATE_ statement
- Learned to apply logic as how I work on other languages
    - Know logic or program flow (know what you want to do first!)
    - Convert logic or created program flow to a working cobol program (work your way from knowing the logic or program flow to applying/programming it!)

### **TO IMPROVE:**
- Add restrictions/error handlers
    - Handle potential errors for input
- Fix appearance
    - Fix leading zeros/spaces
    - Learn and add screen section
