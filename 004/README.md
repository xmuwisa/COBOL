### Instructions
Write a COBOL program that takes the length, width, and height of a rectangular prism as input from the user. Calculate and display both the volume and surface area of the prism using the following formulas:

Volume = Length x Width x Height

Surface Area = 2 x (Length x Width + Width x Height + Height x Length)

Your program should then display the calculated volume and surface area.
