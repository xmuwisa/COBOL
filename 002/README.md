 **<h1 align="center">Kids and their toys?</h1>**

### **PROGRAM FUNCTIONS**
- Read 3 inputs from input file: ID, toy type, number of toys
- Count the total of kids in the record with their IDs
- Evaluate the toy type with A as soft and B as hard
- Add each kid's total number of toys 

### **NOTES**
- Improved my patience /(TT-TT)\
- Learned file handling
    - _READ_
    - _WRITE_
- Improved skill in debugging and applying logic

<br/>

### **TO IMPROVE:**
- Will review if there are code inconsistencies/inefficiencies 
- Additional functions
- Will consult with someone

<br/>

> From the previous programs, I only tried to test and learn programming basic programs in COBOL. I wrote in their TO IMPROVE: section the improvements I think are needed, or should I go back to for. But I had a great conversation with someone. <br/><br/>I didn't know much about COBOL- its use, its history. Even so, I delved into it and tried to learn by starting on creating basic programs. My main goal in delving here is to be able to make a program that my group will submit for our midterms and finals. Okay, so, just as I have mentioned in my previous programs, one of their improvements I included is error handling. I was kind of impatient and annoyed about how I see my program's code inefficient (including the test programs I have not uploaded here), but I was told that COBOL was not like the other languages I am used to!<br/><br/>So, just to shorten it- these are the key terms/points I learned from my friend as we discussed COBOL: PUNCH CARDS, ACCOUNTING/BANK, COMPUTATION, PROVIDED INPUT AND COBOL PROCESSES IT, AND ITS USE IS NOT THE SAME AS HOW THE NEWER LANGUAGES ARE USED. Great! And so that really boosts my progress in learning COBOL. <i>Thanks again, Lou!</i><br/><br/>I then fast-forwarded to practicing file handling since it is what I am going to need to program our midterm's COBOL program, and since our midterm is nearing. What my plan for our midterm's program seemed simple (I thought it was simple too, lol), but it was actually really hard to program. Maybe because I just started learning COBOL lately? I had everything processed in my mind, but my hand can't seem to keep up. So, I made this simple program as practice, as it was similar to what I will do for our midterms. THANKFULLY, IT WORKED!ðŸ¤©<br/><br/>I'm so happy this worked. This is just a simple program, but it feels awesome to make it from scratch. I'm grateful for my acquired skillset in other languages as they really help; it just feels like converting another language into COBOL's syntax. <i>Anyhow, I hope to continue making progress! If you are reading this, I hope you'll enjoy what you started learning too~</i>
