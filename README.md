This repository serves as a documentation hub for my COBOL learning journey. In this space are the programs I have created and will create while exploring COBOL, each neatly organized in folders numbered from 000 onwards. Within each folder, there's a README.md file outlining the program's functionalities, accompanied by my personal notes and identified areas for improvement. Additionally, I've provided a dissection of each program, explaining how it works. **This is all to document my learning journey.**
